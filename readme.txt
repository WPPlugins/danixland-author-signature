== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I style the plugin to look like my theme? =

every tag that's output by the plugin has either a class or an id attached to it, so that you can style it the way you want it.

= I'm stuck with your plugin and don't seem to be able to customize it/make it work, can you help me? =

Of course, you can ask for help on [the forums](http://wordpress.org/support/) or write a comment on the main article for this plugin on [my site](http://danixland.net/?p=3694), I'll reply ASAP ;)

= I'd like this plugin to be translated in my language, can you do this for me? =

**danixland author signature** ships with a .POT file that can be used to create a translation of the plugin in your language, so if you're familiar with english you can help by providing a translation and it will be added to future versions of the plugin along with a link to your profile on these pages ;)

To provide a translation simply edit the file "danixland-author-signature.pot" and fill every line with the traduction in your language, then save it as *yourlanguagecode.po* (E.G. it_IT.po for Italian), then contact me via the forums or my site and I'll tell you how to send this file to me. I'll add your translation ASAP.

A number of softwares exists to help you with .po files, like [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) or [Lokalize](https://www.kde.org/applications/development/lokalize/ "for kde users")
